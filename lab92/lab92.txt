1..What is the differencebetween the following 2 statements?
SetTimeout(booyah, 2000);
//Calles the function after the timer goes off after 2 seconds.
SetTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
//calles the function booyah immediately rather than waiting for 2 seconds
2..What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
            var myfunc = function(a, x) {
                return a * x;
            };
            var x = myfunc(2, 3);
            var y = myfunc;         
            alert(x);
            alert(y(2,3)); 
Both of them display 6

3..Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
SetTimeout(booyah, 2000);
                    function booyah1() {
                        alert("BOOYAH");
                    } 
SetTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

                function booyah2(){
                    setTimeout(booyah1,2000);
                }
4..What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
Unobtrusive JavaScript is the way of writing JavaScript language in which we properly separate Document Content(html) ,presentation(css)
and behavior(javaScript)thus allowing us to make a clear distinction between them.
The reasons for using: it separates your concerns, keeps your code clean, and allows you to work on the JavaScript without touching either HTML or CSS.
and also it makes our code easy to update and to debug.
